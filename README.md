# mod3_project

This repo contains:
* Description of the project in a PDF
* Three python starter files
* Three test files
* A starter jupyter notebook

Datasets used:
* https://www.football-data.org/documentation/api - Football Data API for information about premier league matches 2018/2019
* https://footystats.org/ - The free version of the footystats API for player information for the premier 2018/2018 season
* https://datahub.io/sports-data/english-premier-league - Additional match information pulled from csv

Hypotheses to be tested:

1. Is a team more likely to win playing at home?
    * $H_0$: There is no relationship between the team's home and away match performance.
    * $H_1$: A team is significantly more likely to win if they play at home.
    * $H_2$: A team is significantly less likely to win if they play at home.

2. Is there a relationship between the age of a player and the minutes that the player plays?
    * $H_0$: There is no relationship between a player's age and the minutes that a player plays in a season.
    * $H_1$: A player is significantly more likely to play more minutes if they are older.

3. If there are more cards in a game, are there more goals scored?
    * We create a ratio for each match between the goals scored and the number of cards in a match.
    * $H_0$: There is no significant reltationship between the number of cards in a game and the number of goals scored. 
    * $H_1$: If the if there are more cards in a game, it significantly more probable that there will be more goals.
    * $h_2$: If there are more cards in a game, it is significantly less probably that there will be more goals.
